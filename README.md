# TravelingSalesman
Brute Force Model of the Traveling Salesman Problem

**Traveling Salesman Problem:** “Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.”

**Brute Force Approach**
- Populate 2D array with all distances between any two points
- Recursively computes all possible permutations of routes with no fixed starting point nor destination
- Cycle through all permutations of n Cartesian points and compute the relative cost of each route
- Find the route with the minimum cost
- Swing and graphics visually model the shortest path
